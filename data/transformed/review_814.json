  "review_text": "Bad: Some of the front desk staff came off a bit rude. This is a nicer hotel, and we just felt like since we don't always dress fancy - after all, we were on vacation and out and about all day, every day - that we were looked down upon. We aren't fancy people but wanted to spoil ourselves for our anniversary. Good: We loved the location and the style of the hotel and the rooms. Caesar at the door was extremely welcoming and helpful.",
