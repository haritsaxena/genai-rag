  "review_text": "Bad: Hotel was under a major renovation n there is no casino n no restaurants within the hotel. Ice machine was broken on our floor. You have to have key access to get ice from other floors but no access ever given. We had to ask 6 times for keys! They wouldn't work at all! Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way. Good: Beds we're comfy",
