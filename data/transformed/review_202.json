  "review_text": "Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good.",
