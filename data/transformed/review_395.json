  "review_text": "I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area.",
