  "review_text": "Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else.",
