  "review_text": "Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner.",
