  "review_text": "Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient.",
