  "review_text": "Bad: The music in the lobby was horrendous. House music that made me want to die or run away with my hands over my ears. Totally cruel to make the hotel receptionists listen to that all day long and it made the lobby an undesirable place to spend time. They should be playing jazz or something easy on the ears. Good: Location and room/decor, amenities",
