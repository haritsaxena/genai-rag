In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge. Decor stylish, cozy room made clever use of small space, room clean, rain shower nice. Non-convention type hotel very appealing. Really great value in accessible walkable location.\n",
